# StuEnrolManage

A simple student management system using the SSM framework, Java Springboot+Vue3+MyBatis, and MySQL database

nstallation note: The front-end requires the installation of Vue3 scaffolding, Vuex, and element plus components. The back-end uses Java Spring Boot and is developed based on Java JDK8. The required dependencies can be updated to the Maven library.

The database requires three tables that need to be created by oneself. There is a folder in the folder that contains information about the database and stores the usage of the three tables. You can also create corresponding tables based on the code. Please note to modify the links and ports required for database mapping in Java code.
